### What is this?

This is a go client library to interact with the website senturion.to

### Installation:

pretty standard go stuff:

```go
go get github.com/jdingbat/sntrn
```

A pretty standard example is included in the `examples` directory as a "get started" guide.

### How can I help?

If you know anything more about their unofficial API that could be useful then feel free to
open a pull request.
